Hello, my name is Dragos Albastroiu. At the moment I'm a student at ETH ZÃ¼rich, doing my Master's in Cyber Security, with a minor in Machine Intelligence. 

University of Bucharest - Computers and Information Technology alumni, finished with overall grade 10.

Doing bug bounty on Meta products in my free time.

In my free time I enjoy playing the guitar, video games and of course participating in CTF competitions.
