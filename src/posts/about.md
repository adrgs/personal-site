Hello, my name is Dragoș Albăstroiu.

At the moment I'm a student at ETH Zürich, doing my Master's in Cyber Security with a minor in Machine Intelligence.

Doing bug bounty on Meta products in my free time.

I enjoy playing the guitar, video games, travelling and of course participating in CTF competitions with my awesome team, [WreckTheLine](https://twitter.com/WreckTheLine).
