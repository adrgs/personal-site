Hello, I'm Dragos. At the moment I'm a student at the University of Bucharest, doing my bachelors in Computers & Information Technology. 

I'm also working as a Security Engineer - Incident Responder at Adobe.

In my free time I enjoy playing the guitar, video games and of course participating in CTF competitions.

You can contact me at adragos [@] protonmail.com

I'm also on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dragosalbastroiu/)
